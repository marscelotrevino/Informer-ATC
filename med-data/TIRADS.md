The TIRADS (Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System) is a standardized classification system employed in radiology to categorize thyroid nodules based on their ultrasound characteristics, aiming to estimate the risk of malignancy. Each characteristic of a thyroid nodule is assigned specific points: 

- **Composition**: Cystic or almost completely cystic (0 points), Spongiform (0 points), Mixed cystic and solid (1 point), Solid or almost completely solid (2 points). 
- **Echogenicity**: Anechoic (0 points), Hyperechoic or isoechoic (1 point), Hypoechoic (2 points), Very hypoechoic (3 points). 
- **Shape**: Wider-than-tall (0 points), Taller-than-wide (3 points). 
- **Margin**: Smooth (0 points), Ill-defined (0 points), Lobulated or irregular (2 points), Extrathyroidal extension (4 points). 
- **Echogenic foci**: None or large comet-tail artifacts (0 points), Macrocalcifications (1 point), Peripheral (rim) calcifications (2 points), Punctate echogenic foci (3 points). 

After evaluating all characteristics, the total points are summed. The nodule is then classified into a TIRADS category based on its total score: 

- TR1: 0 points (Benign) 
- TR2: 2 points (Not Suspicious) 
- TR3: 3 points (Mildly Suspicious) 
- TR4: 4-6 points (Moderately Suspicious) 
- TR5: 7 or more points (Highly Suspicious) 

The TIRADS system aids clinicians in determining the need for further diagnostic procedures, such as fine-needle aspiration, based on the nodule's risk profile.
